# CSCA 5642 Week 3 Convolutional Neural Network Project  
***

This project is a submission to [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview), as a brief project to learn about CNNs.

## Files  
***  
- main.ipynb
  - the main notebook that includes the entire modelling process and analysis
- history*.json
  - the history objects storing the results of different model iterations
- cancer_predictions.csv
  - the final submission to the project
- first_down_model.h5
  - a stored keras model used for the final submission.
  - a demonstration for loading and predicting with this model is in the notebook in the results section

### Note:  
> *The data is downloaded from the Kaggle competition website, and is extracted to a folder named 'data' within the root directory. This is how the files are referenced in the main notebook. I did not include them in this repo due to their size.*
